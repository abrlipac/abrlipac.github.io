      <h2 class="subheading">Who am I?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I am someone who has spent a lot of time in his life studying and who is
        now looking to apply all his knowledge acquired over the years.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I really enjoy video games, I love to laugh at simple things and even
        though I like being with others, I usually enjoy being alone.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subheading">What do I do?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        For two years I have been studying systems engineering at a private
        university. In 2018 I finished a professional technical degree in
        computing and information technology.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Well, I don't currently have university classes, so I'm trying to learn
        from the internet as much as I can, I'm trying to reinforce previous
        knowledge and trying to learn something new to apply in future projects.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subheading">What do I want to do?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I want to work in a company that wants to grow very fast, I want to be
        part of that. I want to try different jobs related to the world of
        technology, especially software development and generate income to
        continue learning and to make better decisions.
